Using DOD CAC on Ubuntu
===

This was verified to work on Ubuntu 13.10 with Firefox 30 (27 Sep 14).

Super simple:

1. Follow the instructions on the (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonAccessCard)[Ubuntu community wiki]
2. Install cackey from this repository
	* This is the package from Forge.mil, included here for ease of installation since Forge.mil requires a working CAC to download
3. Install dod_configuration in Firefox
